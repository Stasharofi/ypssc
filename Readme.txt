The first file is the results of structural analysis of transmembrane proteins in yest that has been performed in http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/
The second file is the the peptides.txt wich is normally produced after a regular analysis in MaxQaunt.
The file in the peptides contains many columns for many samples; for each sample you need to keep the following  columns and delete the rest. Keep “Sequance, “start.position”, “End Position” and “ Experiment …” which contains the peptide information regarding a specific sample.
