# ypssc: Yeast-Proteome Secondary-Structure Calculator

An extension for 'NetSurfP-2.0' which is specifically designed to analyze the results of bottom-up-proteomics that is primarily analyzed with 'MaxQuant'. This tool is designed to process a large number of yeast peptides that produced as a results of whole yeast cell-proteome digestion and provide a coherent picture of secondary structure of proteins.

## What is `ypssc`?

**`ypssc`** is an extension for NetSurfP-2.0 which is specifically designed to analyze
the results of bottom-up proteomics that is primarily analyzed with MaxQuant. We call
this tool _**Yeast Proteome Secondary Structure Calculator**_ (**`ypssc`**). This tool
is designed to process a large number of yeast peptides that produced as a results of 
whole yeast cell-proteome digestion and provide a coherent picture of secondary structure
of proteins.

### Functionalities in `ypssc`:

1. `findSecondary`
2. `findAlpha`
3. `findBeta`
4. `findChain`


###  Note: NetSurfP

- NetSurfP-1.0 is a prediction tool for secondary structures using neural network.

- NetSurfP-2.0 is an extension of NetSurfP-1.0 which utilized deep neural network to
  predict secondary structures with the accuracy of 85%. In addition to accuracy, this
  tool presents reduced computational time compared to other methods.

- NetSurfP-2.0 is designed to be user friendly and efficient in calculation time of
  large number of sequences. In addition to that the output of the calculation is 
  available in many formats that would make further data analysis even easier.

- NetSurfP-2.0 is available as a web-sever (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP-2.0/)
  which can accept up to 4000 sequences at a time.

## Why this package?

This tool is designed to process large number of yeast peptides that produced as a
results of whole yeast cell proteome digestion and provide a coherent picture of secondary
structure of proteins. NetSurfP-2.0 is not designed to do this task.

### Drawbacks of NetSurfP-2.0**

- First, NetSurfP-2.0 is not designed to accept as many peptides at once, therefore the
  process of uploading the sequences and waiting for the calculations to be complete is 
  extremely time consuming.

- Second, even if all sequences uploaded successfully and the results are back, it would 
  be almost impossible to combine the results that have been produced for each individual 
  peptide  (hundreds of thousands of spread sheets) to get a coherent picture of the 
  secondary structure of the proteins.



### Advantages of `ypssc`

- **`ypssc`**, on one hand benefits forms the accuracy of NetSurfP-2.0 to calculate secondary
  structure and on the other hand address the issue of analyzing so many peptides with 
  NetSurfP-2.0 by eliminating the need for direct analysis of the peptides from bottom-up
  proteomics.

- Instead of direct analysis of peptides by NetSurfP-2.0 which raises the problem of combining
  the results of peptides to proteins, the whole yeast proteome has been analyzed once by 
  NetSurfP-2.0 and kept as Secondary Structure Database for Yeast Proteome (SSDYP). Then the
  peptides form the experiment are matched and compared to this database to extract secondary
  structure of the peptides.

## Methodology

The SSDYP contains structural information for all amino acids of whole yeast proteome (Over
3000,000 amino acids) which contains over 6700 proteins. For a hypothetical protein, the 
SSDYP contains the ID of the protein, amino acids with numbers and structural information for
each amino acid. Focusing on the hypothetical protein, in the real sample, there are many 
peptides identified from the hypothetical protein. **`ypssc`** first finds all the peptides 
that belongs to the hypothetical protein and arrange them based on the numbers of the amino 
acids; then it removes the parts of the protein that have been identified more than once in
multiple peptides and collapses the population of identified peptides in the sample into one 
sequence that represents the coverage of the hypothetical protein. The result would show that 
which part of the protein is identified, and which part is missing. Then, **`ypssc`** matches
the the sequence that identified in the sample with SSDYP to find the structural information
about amino acids.
